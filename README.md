 Version-Controlled Project with Git

 Objective

To manage a DevOps project using Git best practices, including proper commit history, branching strategy, pull requests, tagging,

- Git
- GitHub


1. Repository Initialization 
   - Created a Git repository locally  
   - Connected and pushed to a GitHub remote

2. Branching Strategy
   - main – Stable production-ready code  
   - dev – Integration branch for upcoming changes  
   - feature/<feature-name> – Individual feature branches

3. Pull Requests
   - Feature branches are merged into `dev` via pull requests  
   - After testing, `dev` is merged into `main`

4. Git Tags
   - Used lightweight or annotated tags for versioning (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`)

5. .gitignore
   - Added a `.gitignore` file to avoid tracking unnecessary files like logs, temp files, and IDE configurations

6. Documentation
   - Task description and workflow are documented using markdown in this `README.md`
